The project aims to represent a layered back-end for a CRUD system to handle the registration, retrieval, updating, and deletion of pet information.

The layers are **Communication** – which handles requests and responses, **Application** – which defines the Use Cases for each HTTP method, that is, the business rules, and finally the **API** layer, which contains the Controller.
